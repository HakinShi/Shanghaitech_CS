Oct 15 meeting

  semantic segmentation of large scale point cloud
  
  Progress:
  SqueezeSeg V3 implement, got the feauter maps and initial segmentation point cloud.(opensource)
  RandLAnet trainning and validation.
  
  Next stage:
  Collect the point cloud data of ShanghaiTech campus with Velodyne.
  Test RandLAnet and get the predictions lables to evaluation.
  Continue to make a survey about state of the Art.
  
  

Oct 22 meeting
  Longtian got clear about SqueezeSegV1, Qianjing got clear about SqueezeSegV2.

  Task for the following week:
    1. get familiar with the Jackle
    2. clarify the difference between semanticKITTI sensor and Sensors in Jackle.

  Deling finish the debugging and make inference work. 

  Task for the following week:
    1. upload the result to the benchmark

Nov 4 meeting
  Progress: slove the bug of tensorflow and are busy with Midterm
  Task for the following week: design the algrithm and implement
  
Nov 12 meeting
  Progress: understood SqueezeSegV3, got the predition lables
  Task for the following week: modify code and achieve multiple layers, collect 3d Lidar data of campus
  
Nov 19 meeting(wechat meeting)
  Progress:Jackal recorded some laboratory data and learned the SemanticKitti file structure; 
           SqueezeSeg+RandLA experiment was carried out, and the experimental lift was limited.
  Task for the following week:collect 3d Lidar data of campus, modify code and achieve multiple layers.
  
Nov 26 meeting
  Progress:Jackal has recorded some data from underground parking lots and point cloud on campus, and is doing data processing.
           The multilayer structure of SqueezeSeg is realized.
  Task for the following week:Intermidiate report. Evaluation with multilayer structure model and modify. Campus point cloud data processing.
  
Dec 3 meeting
  Progress: Midterm Report
  Task for the following week: improve model and make a survey, process campus data
  

=======
Dec 10

intermediate report 100%

 * fix citation (need 13)
 * make it look nice - add pictures (of data collection robot, other nice pictures)

 * push forward

=======
Dec 17

 * learned this Hierarchical Permutohedral Lattice FlowNet paper
 
=======
Dec 24

 * Hierarchical Permutohedral Lattice FlowNet doesn't work, because range image is not spare. 
   Maybe we can try it in other model like volex.

=======
Dec 30

 * collect campus velodyne data, but this is too sparse and KITTI uses Velodyne64
 * redesign network applying RefineNet about 2d images segmentation
 
 * try to process campus data and make it useful
 * push progress!!
 
=======
JAN 5

 * achive refine net
 * try to collect 128 beams data(we don't have 32 beams lidar)(maybe don't have time)
 
 * achive multy layers refinenet
